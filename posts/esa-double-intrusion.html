        <h2>What happened</h2>
        <p>
          The European Space Agency confirmed a December 26, 2025 breach on its external science servers after a threat
          actor calling itself “888” advertised roughly 200 gigabytes of stolen data on BreachForums. Within weeks, a
          second group tying itself to Scattered Lapsus$ claimed another 500 gigabytes of material, including mission
          procedures, satellite documentation, and supplier secrets.
        </p>

        <h2>Timeline</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Dec 18–26, 2025:</strong> “888” gains access to external servers, hoards source code, API tokens,
            Terraform files, and internal Bitbucket/JIRA snapshots, then posts proof on BreachForums.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Dec 29–30, 2025:</strong> ESA acknowledges the breach, describing the affected servers as limited
            to unclassified science endpoints.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Early Jan 2026:</strong> Scattered Lapsus$ “Hunters” claim 500 GB more stolen via the same flaw; ESA
            launches a criminal probe. Data includes contractor notes from SpaceX, Airbus, and Thales Alenia Space.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What was at risk</h2>
        <p>
          The stolen troves were said to contain CI/CD pipeline configurations, JIRA tickets, API keys, and credentials for
          platforms like Bitbucket. The sheer quantity of Terraform and SQL files creates a stepping stone for attackers to
          pivot to more sensitive networks by reusing credentials or misconfiguring new infrastructure. Even if ESA called
          the servers “unclassified,” the stolen engineering context gives attackers narratives on upcoming missions and
          system dependencies.
        </p>
        <p>
          ESA’s own note warns that the attackers had access to “source code, CI/CD pipelines, API/access tokens, hardcoded
          credentials, private repositories, and configuration artifacts,” which means any builder or supplier tied to
          those tools must now rotate secrets and verify supply chain integrity.
        </p>

        <h2>Why this keeps matters</h2>
        <p>
          Reusing the same vulnerability twice — once for 200 GB, once for 500 GB — highlights a patch management gap.
          Without an isolated bastion or a proper zero-trust policy on the science networks, attackers simply re-entered
          the same external portal. The doubled exposure also shows why mission data is only as safe as the vendor
          ecosystems that feed it.
        </p>
        <p>
          The incident has historical context: ESA’s 2024 merchandise store skimming attack and a 2015 breach keep
          resurfacing as proof that sophisticated intruders remain interested in the space agency’s supply chain.
        </p>

        <h2>Defender takeaways</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Treat “unclassified” systems as high-risk if they expose CI/CD or developer tools.
          </li>
          <li>
            Rotate API tokens and keys as soon as an external server shows evidence of odd downloads or persistence.
          </li>
          <li>
            Isolate contractor portals with MFA, least privilege, and separate monitoring so a breach on an external
            system cannot cascade inward.
          </li>
        </ul>
