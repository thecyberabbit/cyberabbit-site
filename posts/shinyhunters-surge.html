        <h2>Voice phishing and the new normal</h2>
        <p>
          ShinyHunters is back in circulation with a familiar pattern: they own a voice-phishing or social engineering
          vector, nail down employee access credentials, then probe SaaS databases for rich customer metadata. In February
          2026 the gang leaked 2.56 GB of Figure data, citing CRM dumps, applicant data, KYC documents, and employee
          dossiers (AppliedTech, Feb 20, 2026). A long tail of customers — nearly 1 million accounts — were exposed.
        </p>

        <h2>Luxury brands pay the price</h2>
        <p>
          South Korea’s PIPC slapped Dior, Louis Vuitton, and Tiffany with a combined ₩36 billion (~$25 million) fine
          after malware/voice-phishing incidents compromised over 5 million individuals. Regulators highlighted weak
          staff training around external communications and an overreliance on email OTPs, classic enablers of the same
          ShinyHunters toolkit that worked against Figure and Crunchbase earlier in the year.
        </p>

        <h2>Crunchbase, third parties, and the new blueprint</h2>
        <p>
          Crunchbase confirmed the gang had extracted 2 million records through voice phishing as well. The data went
          beyond personal identifiers, including company contracts and internal notes that an attacker could reuse to
          social-engineer suppliers. These incidents share a blueprint: the attacker starts with a low-profile voice call,
          gathers credentials or API keys, then escalates to whichever SaaS environment contains the highest density of
          customers.
        </p>

        <h2>Lessons for SOCs and privacy teams</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Treat voice phishing like an active threat vector: log who has access to the CRM admin panel and kick off
            identity proofing for every suspicious call.
          </li>
          <li>
            Demo how ShinyHunters reuses the same data exfil pipeline — once they have CRM access, they harvest all
            customer metadata, so your telemetry should flag bulk downloads and exports immediately.
          </li>
          <li>
            Factor in regulatory fallout: brands are now learning that failing to segment CRM and marketing data results
            in multi-million-dollar fines, especially when cross-border customers are affected.
          </li>
        </ul>
