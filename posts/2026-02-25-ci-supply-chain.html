        <h1>CI supply chain backdoor slips into managed kit</h1>

        <p class="hero-sub">A trusted CI tool shipped with a poisoned plugin. The build process signed malicious binaries before incident responders caught the commit.</p>

    <p>Operators quietly pushed a cabinet release for their managed CI platform, but the artifact registry had been tampered with two hours earlier. Attackers injected a build-time hook that captured the signing key and used it to promote malicious drivers.</p>
    <p>Any downstream project depending on that CI pipeline is now potentially compromised—not just by the new commits, but by the lingering signed materials. The vendor patched the tooling and rotated keys, but you need to verify your pipelines for any CI runner that pulled the poisoned package between 12:10 and 14:45 UTC.</p>
    <p>If you can’t rebuild yet, revoke the compromised build certificates and enforce signature validation on the artifact store. Also, check your dependent binaries for the unexpected loader—they call `sysagentd` to phone home.</p>
    <p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> Treat your CI/CD stack like production code. Air-gapped build environments, certificate rotation, and repository verification keep these supply chain surprises from spreading.</p>
